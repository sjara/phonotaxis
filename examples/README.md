1. `example_gui_minimal.py`: Tests Qt installation. You should see a window with minimal text on it.
2. `example_video_tracking.py`: Demo video and object tracking. You should see a window with b/w video from your camera and red dot tracking a black object.
3. `example_gui_control_and_params.py`: Example of adding the session controller and parameters. This will show a window with a green "Start" button and some text boxes for parameters.
4. `example_arduino_analog_inputs.py`: Plot the Arduino analog inputs.
5. `example_arduino_control_widget.py`: Monitor whether Arduino analog inputs cross threshold and control Arduino digital outputs.
